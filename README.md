# jekyll-rpi-khk
[Raspberry Pi Documentation Website HTML, CSS, and JS](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/) modified for my use case.

## To-Do's
- Replace search
  - The search bar is still using the Raspberry Pi Foundation's search. Need to replace it with our own.
- Figure out the boxes layout

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RichardLamb1/jekyll-rpi-khk.git`
2. Install Ruby. You'll need at least version 3.4.5. [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) and [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) are useful here.
3. Install Bundler and Jekyll: `gem install bundler jekyll`
4. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
5. Start your server: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. Open your server: http://localhost:4000

See the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website for more information.
